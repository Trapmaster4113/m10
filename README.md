Reflection: I'm not sure what I did wrong. I tried to recreate mod9 as much as I could and copy all files directly from mod10, but when I use pytest, I only get errors saying couldn't connect to port. I tried so many different things to fix it, but nothing worked. Running the actual program with docker works though. I could access the calculator and pgadmin and the database through pgadmin. I just couldnt' get any of the testing to work.
